Creating Gists with Specific Names
To represent a specific queue, create a GitHub Gist with a descriptive title, such as "Queue: Orders," to clearly identify its purpose. ​GitHub Docs


Within the gist, include a file named appropriately, like orders_queue.json, to store the queue messages. ​


Use the GitHub REST API's "Create a gist" endpoint to programmatically create gists with the desired description and filename. ​


Implementing Operations
Create: Retrieve the gist by its description or ID, append the new message to the existing list within the gist's file, and commit the changes using the "Update a gist" endpoint. ​


List: Retrieve the gist's content and parse the file to list all messages, applying filters as needed. ​


Get-Next: Retrieve the gist's content, identify the first message with a pending status, update its status to in progress, set the status_datetime, record the processing entity's identifier, and commit the changes promptly using the "Update a gist" endpoint to minimize processing conflicts. ​GitHub Docs


Update: Retrieve the gist's content, locate the specific message by its id, modify the content, status, and/or status_datetime as required, and commit the changes using the "Update a gist" endpoint. ​


Delete: Retrieve the gist's content, identify messages with a complete status and a status_datetime older than one day, remove these messages from the list, and commit the updated list back to the gist using the "Update a gist" endpoint. ​


Concurrency Considerations
Atomic Operations: Ensure that operations like "Get-Next" are performed atomically by quickly retrieving, updating, and committing changes to minimize the window for conflicts. ​


Conflict Handling: Implement checks to detect if a message has been modified between retrieval and update, and retry the operation if a conflict is detected. ​


Process Identification: Include an identifier for the processing entity in the message to track which process is handling it.​


By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively manage a message queue using GitHub Gists, leveraging their version control features to track changes and manage message states over time.
