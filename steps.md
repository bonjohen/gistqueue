To implement the message queue system using GitHub Gists, the work can be organized into the following sequential units, grouped by their functional areas:

**1. Setup and Initialization** ✅

- **1.1. Authentication Setup** ✅
  - Obtain and configure the necessary GitHub authentication tokens with the appropriate scopes to interact with the Gist API. 
  - System Environment Variable: GIST_TOKEN

- **1.2. Environment Configuration** ✅
  - Set up the development environment with access to the GitHub REST API, ensuring all required libraries and tools are available.

**2. Gist Management** ✅

- **2.1. Gist Creation** ✅
  - Develop functionality to create a new Gist with a specific description (e.g., "Queue: Orders") and an appropriately named file (e.g., `orders_queue.json`) to represent the message queue.

- **2.2. Gist Retrieval** ✅
  - Implement methods to retrieve existing Gists by description or ID to access the corresponding message queues.

**3. Message Operations** ✅

- **3.1. Create Message** ✅
  - Develop functionality to append a new message with the required fields (`id`, `content`, `status`, `status_datetime`) to the queue file within the Gist.

- **3.2. List Messages** ✅
  - Implement functionality to retrieve and parse all messages from the queue file, with optional filtering based on the `status` field.

- **3.3. Get-Next Message** ✅
  - Develop functionality to identify and retrieve the next message with a `pending` status, update its status to `in progress`, set the `status_datetime` to the current time, and record the identifier of the processing entity.

- **3.4. Update Message** ✅
  - Implement functionality to modify an existing message's `content`, `status`, and/or `status_datetime` as required.

- **3.5. Delete Message** ✅
  - Develop functionality to remove messages marked as `complete` with a `status_datetime` older than one day from the queue file.

**4. Concurrency and Conflict Handling** ✅

- **4.1. Atomic Operations Implementation** ✅
  - Ensure that operations like `Get-Next` are performed atomically by quickly retrieving, updating, and committing changes to minimize the window for conflicts.

- **4.2. Conflict Detection and Resolution** ✅
  - Implement checks to detect if a message has been modified between retrieval and update, and establish a retry mechanism if a conflict is detected.

- **4.3. Process Identification** ✅
  - Include an identifier for the processing entity in each message to track which process is handling it, aiding in conflict resolution and auditing.

**5. Garbage Collection** ✅

- **5.1. Automated Cleanup** ✅
  - Develop a routine to periodically execute the delete operation, removing messages that have been marked as `complete` for over a day to maintain queue hygiene.

By following these organized units of work in sequence, the development of the message queue system using GitHub Gists can be systematically and effectively achieved.
